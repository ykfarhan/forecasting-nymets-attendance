## Introduction
We are living in the age of a global pandemic. Covid-19 has a put a dent in global economy that hasn't been seen in decades. One of the many industries that are suffering is global sports. From Europe to Asia to North America, almost all professional sporting leagues in the world came to a halt in mid 2020. After months of constant delays and uncertainty, top level sporting leagues such the Major League Baseball and the English Premier League resumed with the help of bio-secure bubbles in order to protect playes and staff. Furthermore, teams are playing without the fans to cheer them on at the stadiums. It is a hefty price that sporting institutions around the world are paying.

Major League Baseball is a prime example of how much revenue is being lossed due to the absence of ticket sales. If we look at the New York Mets for example, they reportedly made around $100 million during the 2019 season from tickets sales and other matchday incomes such as consessions and parking sales. If we can succesfully predict attendance for New York Mets home games then not only can we better estimate the revenue that will be lost this season but we can also determine how to increase revenue in following seasons when fans are back allowed in stadiums again. We will use linear regression and time-series modelling in order to predict our target.
